Summary: The gravity data (88,514 records) were compiled largely 
from a state-wide regional gravity study program organized by the 
California Division of Mines and Geology in cooperation with the 
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.  The data base 
was received in February 1983. Principal gravity parameters 
include Free-air Anomalies and Simple Bouguer Anomalies (no 
terrain correction applied).  The observed gravity values are 
referenced to the International Gravity Standardization Net 1971 
(IGSN 71).  The gravity anomaly computation uses the Geodetic 
Reference System 1967 (GRS 67) theoretical gravity formula.  The 
data are randomly distributed within the boundaries of California 
with a few stations in Southern Nevada.
